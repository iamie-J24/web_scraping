This project has been created on virtual environments

1st Install scrapy library in your virtual envuronment.  'pip install scrapy'
2nd create a project using a command 'scrapy startproject projectname', in my case, it was 'scrapy startproject songs'
3rd navigate to your spiders folder and create your spider file where you put all the logic for your data scraping
    -> for me I navigated to songs/songs/spiders/. here I manually created the songsSpider.py file
4th using the CLI run the command 'scrapy crawl spydername -O customname.csv' to retrieve the data
    -> in my case, I ran 'scrapy crawl songs -O songs.csv'. this command downloaded the songs list and their types and populated into songs.csv file
    -> The name songs on 'scrapy crawl songs...' should be the same as you created in the songsSpider file, otherwise it won't work
